## üìñ Overview

In the field of artificial intelligence, combining vision and language is a growing area of research. SimpleVLM aims to provide a straightforward implementation of this concept, making it easier for developers and researchers to experiment with and understand Vision-Language Models.

### Why SimpleVLM?

- **Educational Resource**: This project serves as a learning tool for those interested in deep learning and multimodal models.
- **Modular Design**: Each component is designed to be modular, allowing users to customize and extend functionality.
- **Performance**: With the integration of KV-Caching, we enhance the efficiency of the model, making it suitable for various applications.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- **LlaMA-SmolLM2 Implementation**: A lightweight version of the LlaMA model, designed for ease of use and adaptability.
- **SigLip2 Vision Model**: A robust vision model that works seamlessly with language inputs.
- **KV-Caching Support**: Implemented from scratch, this feature improves model performance during inference.
- **Multimodal Capabilities**: SimpleVLM can handle both text and image inputs, making it versatile for various tasks.
- **Fine-tuning Options**: Users can fine-tune the models for specific tasks, enhancing their effectiveness.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

To get started with SimpleVLM, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SuyogKamble/simpleVLM.git
   cd simpleVLM
   ```

2. **Install Requirements**:
   Ensure you have Python 3.7 or later installed. Then, run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment**:
   It‚Äôs advisable to create a virtual environment for this project. You can do this using `venv` or `conda`.

## üìö Usage

Once you have installed SimpleVLM, you can start using it for your projects. Here‚Äôs a simple example to get you started:

```python
from simpleVLM import SimpleVLM

model = SimpleVLM()
output = model.predict(image_path="path/to/image.jpg", text="Describe this image.")
print(output)
```

### Model Inference

To run inference with the model, you need to provide both an image and a text prompt. The model will then generate a response based on the inputs.

## üß† Models

### LlaMA-SmolLM2

The LlaMA-SmolLM2 model is designed for text generation tasks. It can generate coherent and contextually relevant text based on input prompts. 

### SigLip2 Vision Model

The SigLip2 Vision Model processes images and extracts meaningful features. This model works in tandem with the language model to provide a comprehensive understanding of multimodal inputs.

## üèãÔ∏è Training

If you wish to train the models on your own datasets, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare Your Dataset**: Ensure your dataset is formatted correctly. It should contain paired image and text data.
2. **Training Script**: Use the provided training script to start training your model.
   ```bash
   python train.py --data_path path/to/dataset
   ```

3. **Monitoring**: You can monitor the training process using TensorBoard.
